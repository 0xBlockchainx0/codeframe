        <p>
          You can <strong>build</strong> webpages in Codeframe with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
          in seconds, <strong>share</strong> your work with just a link, and <strong>remix</strong>
          Codeframes from other people with your ideas.

              Open a new Codeframe, start typing, and hit
              <span class="inline fixed button">Preview</span>
              to see your code in action in seconds. Your code should run at
              the speed of your ideas, and Codeframe is built for speed.

            <h3>Share with anyone with just a link</h3>

              Each Codeframe has a <strong>unique link that points to a specific
              version of the project</strong>. This makes it super easy to share
              a Codeframe site or code to anyone in the wor</strong>ld with
              an internet connection –– just send a link!

              Every Codeframe site's source code is public and remixable on Codeframe.
              This means you can find a project you like and build on top of it to
              make it your own, then share it so others can remix your ideas.

        <h2>Who? What? Why?</h2>
        <p>
          So. Why did I make this? Well,
        </p>
        <p>
          I like to work on side projects <em>all the time</em>. My computer is
          littered with quick, small projects from random late nights and weekends
          where I found some time to start hacking on random ideas entertain myself
          or make my life less repetitive. But as I built more and more projects,
          I saw that the least interesting part about starting a new idea –– setting
          everything up, configuring files and scripts –– was also the biggest deterrent
          to my creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I started another side project! Enter <strong class="inline fixed button">Codeframe</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started building Codeframe to solve this problem: it's meant to be <strong>the fastest way
          to go from idea to code running on a live webpage that can be shared with
          anyone on the planet.</strong> Everything from the technical stack from top to bottom,
          to the simplicity of the UI, to the fact that <a href="https://linus.zone/torus">Torus</a>
          comes included into every Codeframe, is designed with the goal of speed of creativity in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also frequently run into opportunities to teach web design and development,
          and find myself wanting something more lightweight and approachable than CodePen,
          Glitch, and Repl.it, which are fantastic alternatives but often too heavy
          or complex for beginners in web development. For these times, Codeframe is
          meant to be a simpler, more approachable alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
          But above all, <strong>Codeframe exists to make it easier to learn how to make things
          on the web, and to make it faster and more painless to build things for the web.</strong>
          If you're a maker of beautiful things on the Internet, I hope you give Codeframe
          a try, and I hope you love it.
